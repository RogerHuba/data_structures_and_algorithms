//    Create a Stack class that has a top property. It creates an empty Stack when instantiated.
//        This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to top when the stack is created.
//        Define a method called push which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to the
//        top of the stack with an O(1) Time performance.
//        Define a method called pop that does not take any argument, removes the node from the top of the stack, and
//        returns the nodeâ€™s value.
//        Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located on top
//        of the stack, without removing it from the stack.
