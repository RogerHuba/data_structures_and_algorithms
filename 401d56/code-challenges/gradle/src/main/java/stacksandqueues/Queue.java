//
//    Create a Queue class that has a front property. It creates an empty Queue when instantiated.
//        This object should be aware of a default empty value assigned to front when the queue is created.
//        Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds a new node with that value to
//        the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance.
//        Define a method called dequeue that does not take any argument, removes the node from the front of the queue,
//        and returns the nodeâ€™s value.
//        Define a method called peek that does not take an argument and returns the value of the node located in the
//        front of the queue, without removing it from the queue.
