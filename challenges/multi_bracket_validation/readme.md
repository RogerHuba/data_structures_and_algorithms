# Multi-bracket Validation.
<!-- Program will validate an input for correct strings ad order -->

## Challenge
<!-- This program will take an input string.
     The string will be evaluated for {}, [], and ().
     The validation will verify that the open and close
     are balanced and in the right order. -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- Decided to break the string into a list, then as we loop through the list
     add each opening string to a new list.  Once an closed string is encountered
     evaluate it to the last item of the new open string.  Once if the same, remove it from each list and continue evaluating. -->
