# Selection Sort
<!-- Divides the list into 2 areas, sorted and unsorted.  Takes the least value and swaps it with the value to the far left.  -->

## Challenge
<!-- In your data-structures-and-algorithms repository create a branch called class-36-sorts
Create a new directory called sorting_algos and add a file called selection.py to that directory
Using resources such as Wikipedia, your peers, etc, implement Selection Sort. -->

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- Big 0 is O(n) for space and O(n^2) for time. -->
